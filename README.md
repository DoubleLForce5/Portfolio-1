# Portfolio-1

## Description 

Creating the first iteration of my portfolio website was a challenge. 
I struggled with sizing my images, getting my navigation bar horizontal, and placing my profile picture in the appropriate location - to name a few. That being said, once I was able to work through the coding concepts and tap into my resources everything worked itself out. 

Creating this portfolio site was extremely gratifying despite the many challenges I faced. Coding is like magic, just make sure you mix your potions a.k.a. code correctly so you don't accidentally teleport yourself to the wrong side of the page.
